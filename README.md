# Twitter-Network-Analysis-of-Competing-Cosmetic-Brands
The goal of this project is to better understand the virtual "chatter" around each cosmetics brand, what makes each brand unique, and what makes each brand different. Network Anaysis in Python will also be used to identify users that are most central to the brand(s) and ones that are hyper interested in the product category (cosmetics) in general. Selected Brands: Too Faced, Urban Decay, MAC Cosmetics.
